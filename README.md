Machine Learning in Javascript
---

## Introduction
Welcome to my project!

This application is a learning tool illustrating the viability of implementing performant Machine Learning. 

Too often I have engaged with web developers who believe Machine Learning is this esoteric concept that, despite their interest, they think they don't have the inteligence for or the tools to even start learning about it. I aim to convince them otherwise and help generate more interest in this topic using a tool almost all web developers are familiar with -- Javascript!

**note will need to comment out the dtabase or setup your own DynamoDB**
 
 ```
 
 You can see a deployed version of this repo [here](goo.gl/aPavMc)
 
 Current Projects Include :
 1.) K-Nearest-Neighbor
 2.) Genetic Algorithms: N-Queens
 3.) Neural Network: Digit Recognizer (Interactive canvas coming soon)
 4.) K-Clustering : movie recommendation next??
